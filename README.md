# AIS-China

This is the wiki code for AIS-China participating in IGEM 2024

This is a test repository. It is deployed on ```igem.sciestu.com```, it is **not the final nor official** wiki. 

The official wiki in on ```2024.igem.wiki/ais-china``` and ```gitlab.igem.org/2024/ais-china``` it is still under construction, please stand back and watch. 

The current github repository will only contain some small update and tests pages and functions as I just learned how to build, run and hot update the jinja2 structure on gitlab so I will be working on the gitlab repository more often.

Thanks, Henry
