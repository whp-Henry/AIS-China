    <h6>Attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) are introduced as a novel mosquito control method combining chemical and
        physical elements. Specifically, ATSBs are the mixture of sugar suspension containing poison (Njoroge et al.,
        2023). Since carbohydrates are a kind of essential nutrient for insects' development, mating, and reproduction,
        sugars in ATSB can attract mosquitoes (Fiorenzano et al., 2017). After the ingestion of sugar baits in the
        ATSBs, mosquitoes can be killed. With their cost-effectiveness and less ethical concerns, ATSBs can be more
        easily approved by the authorities and used by the public (Rochlin et al., 2022). Additionally, experiments
        under various settings all prove a remarkable success in reducing the mosquito population (Rochlin et al.,
        2022). Disappointingly, not all the blood-feeding mosquitoes are attracted by ATSBs, and mosquitoes will not die
        within a short time (Maia et al., 2018). It may take from 24 hours to 10 days for ATSBs to achieve a nearly 100%
        death rate. Therefore, within this range of time, escaped mosquitoes can still transmit the diseases (Rochlin et
        al., 2022).</h6>

    <h6>Top-to-bottom methods are also used for mosquito control. For instance, genetically modified male mosquitos are
        raised in the laboratory released to mate with female mosquitoes, leading to the situation where only
        non-blood-feeding male offsprings can be produced (CDC, 2024). With only non-blooding-feeding male offsprings,
        diseases can hardly be transmitted as the main way of mosquito-borne disease transmission is through the
        exchange of blood. Compared with other techniques, this measure is targeted only on mosquitos, minimizing
        negative impacts on non-target organisms. Nonetheless, this measure is still being studied in the laboratory
        without being implemented. Therefore, considering the undiscovered possible ecological and health impacts, such
        method is still inaccessible for large-scale usage.</h6>

<div class="text" id="text3">
    <h6>Apart from zappers and swatters, chemical methods are also a popular mosquito control option. The main
        components of adulticides include organophosphate, sumithrin, permethrin etc. Though different insecticides may
        differ subtly, most of them target the receptors in insects' nervous systems, whose misfunction will then lead
        to the death of the impacted insects (Uragayala et al., 2015). While immediate effects can be achieved by using
        insecticides, other beneficial insects may also be affected apart from mosquitoes. Also, some negative
        influences on both humans and other animals due to the use of insecticides have been reported. For instance,
        long-term exposure to insecticides can lead to defects in olfaction, and a higher risk of development of
        Parkinson's disease (Mendoza et al., 2023).

        Compared with mosquitofish, physical mosquito control measures are more widely applied. For example, bug zappers
        and electric mosquito swatters with light bulbs and electrified wire nets are the most common ones currently
        being used by the public.
        With the ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by the lightbulbs within these devices, certain insects will be
        attracted and direct themselves toward the device. As they are approaching the light source, they will touch the
        power grid first and be killed by high voltage electricity. With the lack of chemicals and the ease of use of
        such devices, these are the most widely used mosquito control methods. Unfortunately, such a method is less than
        effective since mosquitoes are not sensitive to UV light and therefore can hardly be attracted by it. Instead,
        thousands of non-target insects are killed because of their positive phototaxis. (How Bug Zappers Work, 2001)

        Mosquitofish, Gambusia Affinins, is one of the most classic exampl√©s of biological control. Supported by
        research, a mature mosquitofish can consume about 100 larvae per day for two to three years under various
        temperatures and salinities (ABILITY Magazine, 2017). The ease in raising mosquitofish grants such a method a
        huge advantage. However, given the witnessed aggressiveness of mosquitofish, the local ecosystem may be
        disturbed in the presence of mosquitofish which tend to kill local organisms (Brand et al., 2018). Also, since
        mosquitofish can only live in water, the effectiveness of this method is limited to conditions where water is
        sufficient.
