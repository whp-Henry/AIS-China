            Certain mosquito-feeding organisms are exploited as a method for mosquito control.
            However, such a method may bring ecological disturbances and the effectiveness is limited as organisms can
            only work in fixed conditions.
        </div>
        <div class="method-long">
            Mosquitofish, Gambusia Affinins, is one of the most classic examples of biological
            control. Supported by research, a mature mosquitofish can consume about 100 larvae per day for two to three
            years under various temperatures and salinities (ABILITY Magazine, 2017). The ease in raising mosquitofish
            grants such a method a huge advantage. However, given the witnessed aggressiveness of mosquitofish, the
            local ecosystem may be disturbed in the presence of mosquitofish which tend to kill local organisms (Brand
            et al., 2018). Also, since mosquitofish can only live in water, the effectiveness of this method is limited
            to conditions where water is sufficient.
        </div>

    <div class="method method-physical">
        <div class="method-short">
            Several devices for mosquito control are invented for personal usage, including bug
            zappers and electric swatters. Nonetheless, such devices cannot effectively attract mosquitoes, and bear the
            risk of harming non-target organisms.
        </div>
        <div class="method-long">
            Compared with mosquitofish, physical mosquito control measures are more widely applied.
            For example, bug zappers and electric mosquito swatters with light bulbs and electrified wire nets are the
            most common ones currently being used by the public. With the ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by the
            lightbulbs within these devices, certain insects will be attracted and direct themselves toward the device.
            As they are approaching the light source, they will touch the power grid first and be killed by high voltage
            electricity. With the lack of chemicals and the ease of use of such devices, these are the most widely used
            mosquito control methods. Unfortunately, such a method is less than effective since mosquitoes are not
            sensitive to UV light and therefore can hardly be attracted by it. Instead, thousands of non-target insects
            are killed because of their positive phototaxis. (How Bug Zappers Work, 2001)

    <div class="method method-chemical">
        <div class="method-short">
            While chemical insecticides are also widely used for killing mosquitoes given the
            immediate effects and the ease of use, long-term exposure to these insecticides can bring irreversible
            impacts to both humans and other animals.
        </div>
        <div class="method-long">
            Apart from zappers and swatters, chemical methods are also a popular mosquito control
            option. The main components of adulticides include organophosphate, sumithrin, permethrin etc. Though
            different insecticides may differ subtly, most of them target the receptors in insects’ nervous systems,
            whose misfunction will then lead to the death of the impacted insects (Uragayala et al., 2015). While
            immediate effects can be achieved by using insecticides, other beneficial insects may also be affected apart
            from mosquitoes. Also, some negative influences on both humans and other animals due to the use of
            insecticides have been reported. For instance, long-term exposure to insecticides can lead to defects in
            olfaction, and a higher risk of development of Parkinson’s disease (Mendoza et al., 2023).

        <div class="method-short">
            Raising and releasing genetically modified mosquitoes is a top-to-bottom mosquito
            control method. However, since such a method is still being investigated, the possible ecological and health
            consequences are still not fully discovered, thus making it currently inaccessible to the market.
        </div>
        <div class="method-long">
            Top-to-bottom methods are also used for mosquito control. For instance, genetically
            modified male mosquitos are raised in the laboratory released to mate with female mosquitoes, leading to
            the situation where only non-blood-feeding male offsprings can be produced (CDC, 2024). With only
            non-blooding-feeding male offsprings, diseases can hardly be transmitted as the main way of
            mosquito-borne disease transmission is through the exchange of blood. Compared with other techniques,
            this measure is targeted only on mosquitos, minimizing negative impacts on non-target organisms.
            Nonetheless, this measure is still being studied in the laboratory without being implemented. Therefore,
            considering the undiscovered possible ecological and health impacts, such method is still inaccessible
            for large-scale usage.

            Attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) incorporate the use of chemical and physical means, acting as a
            promising means of mosquito control considering its cost-effectiveness. However, since the attractants in
            ATSBs can rarely attract blood-feeding mosquitoes, the main culprit for mosquito-borne diseases,
            improvements should still be made.
        </div>
        <div class="method-long">
            Attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) are introduced as a novel mosquito control method combining chemical
            and physical elements. Specifically, ATSBs are the mixture of sugar suspension containing poison (Njoroge et
            al., 2023). Since carbohydrates are a kind of essential nutrient for insects' development, mating, and
            reproduction, sugars in ATSB can attract mosquitoes (Fiorenzano et al., 2017). After the ingestion of sugar
            baits in the ATSBs, mosquitoes can be killed. With their cost-effectiveness and less ethical concerns, ATSBs
            can be more easily approved by the authorities and used by the public (Rochlin et al., 2022). Additionally,
            experiments under various settings all prove a remarkable success in reducing the mosquito population
            (Rochlin et al., 2022). Disappointingly, not all the blood-feeding mosquitoes are attracted by ATSBs, and
            mosquitoes will not die within a short time (Maia et al., 2018). It may take from 24 hours to 10 days for
            ATSBs to achieve a nearly 100% death rate. Therefore, within this range of time, escaped mosquitoes can
            still transmit the diseases (Rochlin et al., 2022).
