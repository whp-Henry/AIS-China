                            Our project sought to understand public demand for mosquitocidal products through an online
                            survey. Key findings include dissatisfaction with current product effectiveness (41.6%), a
                            significant shift in public opinion towards mosquito elimination after disease education
                            (86.1%), and safety concerns regarding chemical ingredients (53.5%). The majority of
                            interest comes from domestic gardeners, outdoor enthusiasts, and pet owners, most of which
                            have minimal concern for non-target insects. So we decided to design products for different
                            application scenarios. For personal use product, the price preferences lean towards
                            affordability (&lt;100 CNY). In response, we propose RNAi technology for targeted mosquito
                            control, a 'kill switch' in E. coli for biosafety, and public education on mosquito-borne
                            diseases to foster support for effective strategies. Our approach also considers
                            cost-effective product design and expert consultation for further optimization.

                            Our interview with Professor Yang Liu, the staff in Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and
                            Prevention(Abbr. CDC), illuminated the critical need for addressing mosquito-borne diseases,
                            highlighting transmission patterns, economic impacts, and management challenges. Key
                            obstacles include ineffective products and chemical resistance. Public awareness is low,
                            with limited impact from social media. Despite ongoing efforts, practical application
                            remains hard to achieve. Our project will focus on developing an attractive, safe
                            mosquitocidal device, addressing technical, drug-resistance and biosafety issues, and
                            engaging the public to enhance mosquito control. We also aim to further collaborate with CDC
                            staff to explore the necessity for new, non-resistant insecticides that protect beneficial
                            insects.

                            This interview aimed to understand the efficacy of current mosquito control in parks and to
                            discern the management's needs for innovative solutions. Findings reveal that mosquitoes
                            negatively affect visitor experiences, prompting the park to invest 300,000 CNY in
                            extermination, including chemical and physical methods. While open to new technologies,
                            concerns about efficacy and environmental impact exist. The park's interest in ATSB devices
                            highlights a need for effective, eco-friendly alternatives. Identifying parks management as
                            our end-users, we plan to offer our device for testing to meet their requirements and
                            address their concerns.

                            We learned about the views and needs of the Shenzhen Mountaineering Association on current
                            mosquitoes elimination products using while camping through online surveys. The main
                            findings include 40% of participants complained about current products' lack of
                            effectiveness. In addition, the survey shows that the public is very concerned about the
                            composition and environmental protection of mosquito products, and 42% of participants are
                            willing to pay higher fees for better mosquito control . Based on these survey results, we
                            have strengthened our confidence in targeting camping enthusiasts as our end-users. And we
                            will prove our Moskilla's effectiveness, safety and environmentally friendly effects to
                            improve our market competitiveness.

                            We conducted an interview with another staff in Shenzhen Center for Disease Control (SZCDC)
                            and Prevention to gain further insights into the current status of mosquito-borne diseases
                            (MBDs) in Shenzhen and explore potential solutions for prevention and control. Findings
                            reveal the prevalence of MBDs, limited public awareness in mosquito control, econimic
                            consumption and disadvantages caused by existing prevention measures. Besides, understanding
                            the role of different stakeholders in managing MBDs, we identify street offices and
                            communities as another potential end-users. Moving forward, we aim to partner with SZCDC for
                            Moskilla's integration into their initiatives, commit to ongoing evaluation and adaptation
                            of Moskilla, and engage with local other stakeholders for feedback and collaboration,

                            We contacted the local environmental protection bureau to understand the current chemical
                            extermination methods and their regulatory oversight, as well as the role of mosquitoes in
                            the food chain. Our research indicates that mass mosquito killing could disrupt habitats and
                            affect species that rely on mosquitoes, such as geckos, lizards, and frogs. Additionally,
                            chemical insecticides cause discomfort to residents, highlighting the need for communication
                            and safety measures during the extermination process. We also explored the controversial
                            gene editing technology for mosquito control, considering its potential benefits and risks,
                            including genetic and biosecurity concerns, as well as its secondary effects on animals that
                            consume mosquitoes. Our project's implementation will prioritize the safe domestic use of
                            Moskilla, ensuring minimal environmental impact. With future external application in view,
                            we are committed to meeting the Environmental Protection Bureau's testing standards to

                            We assessed mosquito control measures by the interview with a staff in street office,
                            identifying end-user needs. Current chemical disinfection, while effective, poses
                            sustainability and safety challenges. And street offices recognized public education is
                            vital for addressing misconceptions. Knowing the qualifications of outsourced companies, our
                            Moskilla is confirmed as a better and more ecological alternative. However, broad pest
                            control of chemical disinfection is preferred, as it can eliminate not only mosquitoes but
                            also other pests like cockroaches and fruit flies. We will focus on community engagement,
                            R&D for urban pest shRNAs, and understanding outsourcer qualifications.
