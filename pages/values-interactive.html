In the process of communicating with stakeholders from the CDC and parks, we have found that urban parks, construction sites, and other environments prone to water accumulation all require a new mosquito control method, and a considerable amount of funds are spent on mosquito control and corresponding public education every year. It can be seen that in China, there is social and economic support for new mosquito control methods, and we are fortunate that the protection of public health does not conflict with economic interests."

To achieve our goal, we have communicated with SZU-China 2023 to refine the design of highly specific shRNA.\n" +

We have learned about citizens' safety concerns regarding live bacteria through surveys, so we have selected an applicable kill switch through literature research and experimental design.\n" +
